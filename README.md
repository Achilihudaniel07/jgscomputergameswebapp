* [Getting started](#getting-started)

## Getting started
* First, ensure that node.js & npm are both installed. If not, choose your OS and installation method from [this page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) and follow the instructions.
* This website requires Node 14 to work. You can handle multiple node versions with [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) 
* Next, use your command line to enter your project directory.
* This template comes with a ready-to-use package file called `package-sample.json`. You just need to rename it to `package.json`, then run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies into your project.
